#+title: DocBase
WARNING: This project is currently under heavy development. Use at your own risk.

* Rationale
DocBase is a set of tools useful to get the following
- file documents in a folder hierarchy that may change any time
- have persistent org references to these files
- provide a useful ui to file new documents
 
This is done by creating hard links of all files in a single folder.  Org
references point to those files (which will never be moved).  Now other files
(hard linked) to these files (in the doc-base) can now be safely filed into
changing folder hierarchies without invalidating the org link. The org links can
be resolved to the the file in this hierarchy, if needed.

* TODO implement flow /refile/
* TODO implement flow /persistent org-ref/
